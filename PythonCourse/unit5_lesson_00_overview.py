Debugging/Troubleshooting are the most important topics that any new programmer should be proficient in.
For the first few years of your career, it is not unusual to SPEND MOST OF YOUR TIME trying to fix some bug in your own
code or your teams code. So a well developed debugging mindset and knowledge of available tools will help you go a
long way.

This is a very vast topic and many books have been written on the subject! For the sake of this course, we will confine
ourselves to the tools and techniques mentioned in the lessons.

Each lesson introduces one idea/tool for debugging.
- using visualizer - executing in a visualizer
- rubber duck debugging - describe your problem to a friend or a toy duck
- print debugging - debugging by adding a few print statements and observing the output
- using debugger - executing in a debugger
- inspection - debugging in your mind

Your goal is to get familiar with all of them instead of just 1 or 2 of these methods.
