This is useful when you are learning anything new. Using a visualizer to see if the code really does what you
think it does.

My suggestion for now is to ISOLATE A FAILING TEST (if you are running 10 inputs, which input fails?) and execute
the function in python tutor using those inputs and see what is going on.
