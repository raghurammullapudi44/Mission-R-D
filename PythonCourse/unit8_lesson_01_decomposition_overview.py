 This lesson focuses on taking a reasonably sized problem, decomposing it into  small tasks and then
 modelling them as python classes and methods.

 So far most of our work has been focused on small problems with just one or two functions. Real world problems
 are much bigger and they cannot and should not jammed into a single main function :).

 The assignments in this unit will give you an opportunity to get started on thinking about problem decomposition,
 coding for readability, simplicity, testability and change.

 Here is some REQUIRED READING, do read them multiple times as you do the assignments and try to solve them. You
 wont internalize them on a single read or even a two reads!

 1. http://www.stevemcconnell.com/ieeesoftware/bp16.htm - how and why to write routines (functions)
 2. http://www.stevemcconnell.com/ieeesoftware/bp06.htm - writing software is all about managing complexity, how should
    you think about this?
 3. http://blog.codinghorror.com/i-shall-call-it-somethingmanager/ - on naming things properly, use the ideas there
    but use the python naming conventions when you are coding in python.

The goal for this unit is for you to write readable, well factored 50 line programs. This includes everything you have
learnt so far including debugging, testing and profiling.

unit_assignments = '''
The assignments in this unit will give you experience in decomposing a medium sized problem. Follow instructions in each
assignment to get started.

The decomposition will happen in the piazza group. Once you guys agree on a decomposition, I will upload the file with
the agreed upon skeleton that everyone has to fill up and get working.
